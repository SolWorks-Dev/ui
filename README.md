# UI Library for SolWorks

This library includes the main components used in SolWorks applications. The components are build using React with Typescript and follow the SolWorks color scheme.

The library can be locally viewed and developed on using Storybook. See details on getting started below.

## Getting started

### `npm i`

Install all dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

This script will begin to run the Storybook development server and allow you to view the components within the library.

## Todo

In the future you will be able to import this library directly into a SolWorks application through an NPM package.
